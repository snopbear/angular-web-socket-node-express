# Angular 17 Project with Socket.IO Integration

This project is an Angular 17 application that integrates Socket.IO to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. The backend is powered by a Node.js WebSocket server, hosted at [https://web-socket-server-node-express.onrender.com](https://web-socket-server-node-express.onrender.com).

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic Angular 17 application integrated with Socket.IO to enable real-time updates. It connects to a WebSocket server built with Node.js and Express, allowing you to test real-time communication across multiple browser instances.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Implemented using Socket.IO for seamless WebSocket communication between the Angular client and the Node.js server.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: You can open the application in two different browsers and see the real-time updates being reflected simultaneously.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **Angular CLI** (version 17.x)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angular-socketio-integration.git
   cd angular-socketio-integration
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Update the Socket.IO connection URL in your Angular service:**

   In `src/app/services/socket.service.ts`, replace the connection URL with the following:
   ```typescript
   const socket = io('https://web-socket-server-node-express.onrender.com');
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Angular development server:**
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

3. **Open the application in multiple browser windows or tabs** to test the real-time communication.

## Testing WebSocket Communication

To test the WebSocket functionality:

1. Open the application in two different browsers or browser tabs.
2. Perform any action that triggers Socket.IO events (e.g., sending a message).
3. Observe how the updates are reflected in both browser instances in real-time.
